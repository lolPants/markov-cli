##### CLI to analyze text into a Markov Chain and generate sentences from them.

## üíæ Installation
The package is on the NPM registry as `markov-cli`. Simply install it globally with your NPM client of choice.

## üîß Usage
Once installed globally, verify the command installed with `markov-cli --help`  
There are two subcommands you can use:

### `analyze`
Example usage: `markov-cli analyze input.txt`  
Where `input.txt` is a file containing input strings, separated by newlines.

This will output a file named `input.json` with markov chain data for use in the next subcommand.

### `generate`
Example usage: `markov-cli generate input.json`  
Where `input.json` is a markov chain file generated by the `analyze` command.

This will output a string generated using the markov chain.
